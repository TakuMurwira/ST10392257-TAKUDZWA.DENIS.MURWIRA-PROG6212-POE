Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)

Overview
The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a web-based application prototype designed to simplify the process of submitting and approving monthly claims for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers. This service allows lecturers to submit claims for hours worked, while Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers can review, verify, and approve these claims. This version focuses on the front-end interface without functional backend processing.

How to Use the Service
1. Lecturer Dashboard
Access: Upon opening the application, lecturers will be directed to their dashboard.
View Claims: You can view a list of previously submitted claims and their current status (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).
Submit New Claim:
Click the Submit New Claim button to fill out a claim submission form.
Enter the number of hours worked for the month and submit it (this is only for visual representation).
2. Submit a Claim
Submit Claim Page:
The form allows lecturers to input the hours worked and view a static hourly rate.
Though the functionality is not implemented, this form simulates how lecturers would submit their monthly claims.
3. Coordinator/Manager Dashboard
Access: Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers can access their dashboard to view claims submitted by lecturers.
View Claims: Claims are displayed with their details, including the lecturer’s name, hours worked, total amount, and current status.
Approve/Reject:
Buttons are provided to approve or reject claims, though no actual data processing occurs.
4. Claim Details
Access: On both the Lecturer and Coordinator/Manager dashboards, claims can be clicked to view their full details.
Details: The page shows the lecturer’s name, hours worked, total amount claimed, and the current status (pending, approved, rejected).
For Managers: Coordinators and Managers also have buttons to approve or reject claims on this page (non-functional).
